**Problem:** Finding formula of cylinders area and volume using genetic algorithm and randomly generated expression trees where each internal node corresponds to operator and each leaf node corresponds to operand.

**Definition:** In this problem, the area or volume of 10 cylinders (the experiment set) is calculated and the results are given. The aim is to find formulas that will achieve the same results. Since we find the results in the experiment set from the formula for the area or volume of the cylinder, we expect to obtain these formulas as a result.
